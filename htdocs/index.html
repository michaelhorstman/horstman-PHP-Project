  		<h1> Google Fiber to Louisville </h1>
  		<p>
  		   Louisville has moved near the head of the line among the dozens of communities coveting a fiber-optics network developed by Google Fiber that could provide ultrafast internet service.
  		</p>
  		<p>
				The fiber network, if installed, would greatly increase the speed for downloading material from the Internet, streaming movies, gaming and more. It also would be a boon for local business and economic development that could benefit from the gigabit per second (1,000 megabits) broadband speed, Mayor Greg Fischer said. The average broadband speed in the country is 11.9 Mbps.
			</p>
			<p>
				Fischer said Google Fiber will provide Internet access at least 20 times faster than conventional broadband and that the Google system will not only be faster but also more reliable.

				It's still early and no deal is certain, but Fischer noted that Google Fiber has never walked away from a city it had identified as a potential market.

				Google Fiber's identification of Louisville as a potential market was announced at a news conference at the Code Louisville training office on Floyd Street downtown.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the news conference, Fischer said his administration is starting to work with Google Fiber to explore the possibility of building a new superfast broadband network in the city.

				"This is a big step forward to bringing very high-speed Internet to homes and business in our city, which is critical to job growth and innovation," Fischer said. "From businesses in Louisville that need super-computing speeds to homes that want streaming of very high-definition movies, this has the potential to impact" nearly every part of the city.
			 </p>
			 <p>
				"Abundant high-speed Internet can help communities grow stronger, laying a foundation for innovation and economic growth," said Szuchmacher. "We look forward to working side by side with Louisville in the coming months to explore if we can bring Google Fiber to the city, and help write the next chapter of the Internet, together, on gigabit speeds."

				"We'll continue to talk to anybody," Fischer said, but he added that Google Fiber has the ability to build the system, calling the company "highly capable and capitalized. That is why this is a big deal. We intend to be successful with them."
